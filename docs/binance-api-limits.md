LIMITS

General Info on Limits
The following intervalLetter values for headers:
SECOND => S
MINUTE => M
HOUR => H
DAY => D

intervalNum describes the amount of the interval. For example, intervalNum 5 with intervalLetter M means "Every 5 minutes".

The /api/v3/exchangeInfo rateLimits array contains objects related to the exchange's RAW_REQUESTS, REQUEST_WEIGHT, and ORDERS rate limits. These are further defined in the ENUM definitions section under Rate limiters (rateLimitType).
Requests fail with HTTP status code 429 when you exceed the request rate limit.
IP Limits
Every request will contain X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter) in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
Each route has a weight which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier weight.
When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).
IP bans are tracked and scale in duration for repeat offenders, from 2 minutes to 3 days.
A Retry-After header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the number of seconds required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.
Unfilled Order Count
Every successful order response will contain a X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter) header indicating how many orders you have placed for that interval.

To monitor this, refer to GET api/v3/rateLimit/order.
Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-** headers in the response.
If you have exceeded this, you will receive a 429 error with the Retry-After header.
Please note that if your orders are consistently filled by trades, you can continuously place orders on the API. For more information, please see Spot Unfilled Order Count Rules.
The number of unfilled orders is tracked for each account.
